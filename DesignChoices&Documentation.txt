Design Choices & Documentation
1. Overview

This document explains the design decisions and architecture of the Image Management Platform built for the assignment.
It covers the frontend, backend, authentication flow, and Cloudinary integration.

2. Frontend Design Choices

Framework: React.js was used for building the frontend due to its component-based architecture and ease of managing state with hooks.

Styling: Tailwind CSS was used for rapid styling and responsiveness.

Routing: React Router was used for navigation (signup, login, dashboard).

Error Handling: Error and loading states are displayed to the user during API calls.

Image Gallery: Images are displayed in a responsive masonry/grid layout for a clean and user-friendly experience.

3. Backend Design Choices

Framework: Node.js with Express.js was chosen for building RESTful APIs.

Database: MongoDB was used for storing user credentials and image metadata because of its flexibility with JSON-like documents.

Authentication: JWT (stored in httpOnly cookies) ensures secure authentication and prevents XSS attacks.

Middleware: Custom middleware was implemented to verify tokens and authorize access to protected routes.

4. Authentication Flow

Signup: User provides name, email, and password. Password is hashed with bcrypt before storing in DB.

Login: User submits credentials, verified against DB, and a JWT is issued and stored in an httpOnly cookie.

Auth Middleware: Each request checks for JWT validity. Only authenticated users can access their images or upload new ones.

Logout: Clears the cookie and invalidates the session on the client side.

5. Cloudinary Integration

Image Storage: Cloudinary was integrated for secure and scalable image storage.

Upload Flow: Images are uploaded via multer middleware and streamed directly to Cloudinary.

Metadata: After upload, image metadata (publicId, secure URL, original filename) is stored in MongoDB.

Access: Users only see their own uploaded images, fetched securely from the backend.

6. Security Considerations

httpOnly Cookies: Prevent XSS attacks by not exposing tokens to client-side JS.

Validation: Only image file types are allowed during upload using multer fileFilter.

Authorization: Ensures users only access their own images by checking userId against JWT payload.

7. Deployment

Backend: Deployed on Render.

Frontend: Deployed on Vercel with routing configured to handle React Router paths.

Environment Variables: Managed securely via .env files (API keys, DB URIs, Cloudinary credentials).

8. Conclusion

This setup balances simplicity and security while meeting the assignment requirements.
It ensures a smooth user experience with secure authentication, reliable image storage, and responsive design.
